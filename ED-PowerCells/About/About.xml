Power cells are created at the PowerCell Creation Station from 2 Components.

Power Cells are then Placed Next to a PowerCellStation. This station can be switched between 2 modes, Charging or Discharging.
Charging mode will take an adjacent Charged Power Cell and turn it into a Discharged Power Cell, while consuming power.
